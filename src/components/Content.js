              I have told her that hers will go far.
              <br></br>
              'Oh, it's really not cool
              <br></br>
              driving this crap to school.'

              'The kids will all laugh at the rust.
              <br></br>
              When we race, I'll be left in the dust! 
              <br></br>
              I will save up some cash
              <br></br>
              then we'll make a mad dash
              <br></br>
              to the car dealer surely you trust'.

              <br></br>
              <br></br>

              'He will make us a wonderful deal
              <br></br>
              and I'm sure you will know how I feel.
              <br></br>
              I will love you so much, 
              <br></br>
              My siblings... I won't touch.
              <br></br>
              Just get me behind a new wheel'! 

              <br></br>
              <br></br>

              Now she'll be cruisin in style.
              <br></br>
              She'll be happy for only awhile.
              <br></br>
              There will always be better
              <br></br>
              and we'll try hard to get her
              <br></br>
              a car that will make princess smile."
